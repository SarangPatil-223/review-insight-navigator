Review
"This superior mobile device offers significant enhancements over previous iterations. Its high-capacity battery enables extended usage, complemented by rapid charging capabilities even faster if you have a 45W charger. Preliminary assessments indicate highly favorable performance. Acquisition of this device is strongly advised. The phone's robust design incorporates a metal frame, a departure from prior models, while maintaining an ergonomic profile. Its dimensions are comparable to the S23 Ultra, although featuring more rounded edges. Considering its size, storage capacity, operating system, battery life, and photographic capabilities, it presents exceptional value. This device is highly recommended."
"Best phone I've ever owned. I really am happy with this purchase. I wish there was more value for the money, but battery life and all the new software is really good. Durability so far is great, but I instantly put on camera covers, screen protectors, and a case. Gotta baby smartphones or you will regret it long term. The plus is the perfect size for me. I wish I had gotten the ultra only for the cameras, but in my opinion the price difference is not worth it. Takes really amazing photos even though I am only reviewing the s25+."
"I bought 2 of these for my wife and I, and we love it. Photos look great, and I am constantly finding new and cool features supported by the phone. The AI tools are really useful and fun. Granted it sometimes needs you to reword it, but it is surprisingly useful especially with photos. We have had these for a few weeks and I would definitely recommend these."
"This phone is amazing. I upgraded from an already top-of-the-line S23 to the S25+ and I can already see the difference. Super smooth scrolling, blazingly fast app loading. Excellent camera. Generous storage. Lots of customizability."
"Good - beautiful screen. Blazing fast. Amazing camera. Looks great. Same as the 21,22,23,24

Bad - palm rejection is terrible. There’s no way to use the phone case less. And movement registered by the palm, caused the phone to cancel out your actual taps. So like Steve said a decade ago…”you’re holding it wrong” or it just sucks.

Screen is vivid… but as always blow out many of the photos and videos you view on screen….something to keep in mind as your photos will look differently on a computer or on an iPhone.

Most annoying - WiFi drops suddenly or when not in use for a bit. Usually it’ll reconnect in a second on my iPhone…takes over a minute on the s25. Very annoying when low cell coverage.

And worst of all…why buy at this price if next week Amazon will discount this for 100 dollars ? Not going to get hit with the lower price 31 days later…"
"I am an older person (65) and for yrs went to a phone store so I could have data transferred from my old phone to my new phone; and of course paying premium $$$ for the phone and the service. NOT anymore!! I bought this new Samsung and upon charging it literally walked me through Step-by-Step on how to transfer my phone data, contacts, apps, etc...and keeping my phone number. I also received $200.00 from Amazon!! So getting the best phone on the market at a great deal!! I am not tech savvy AT ALL, so was so proud that I took this small leap of faith to do it myself (it was one of the easiest tech things I have ever done) and saved several hundred dollars by doing so!! Love this phone! The Camera takes excellent pictures and videos and the features are great! Love also that I got back $200.00 Amazon gift card!!"
"This was a major upgrade for us, we went from a S9 to this S25. It is amazing how fast it is and how much better it looks.

We are still getting use to them, yet we love them.

My husband got the S25 with the 256 memory I think it is and I got the S25 Ultra with the I think 512 memory.

He didn't want a phone much bigger than his old S9 and I wanted a phone bigger than the S9.

Mine isn't huge yet it definitely makes the regular one look smaller when I use his.

They look sleek and very nice!!

They are fast and I don't have any issues with lag or anything like that."
"I upgraded from a S22 and this phone has many more bells and whistles, especially as it relates to AI and effortless completion of tasks. The data transfer goes very smoothly and the phone leads you through the steps easily. But here is what they do not tell you: the data transfer does not transfer anything you have paired and it does not transfer logons and passwords for all of the Apps transferred. There is still a massive amount of work to do to get to the smooth operation of your previous phone. Battery life is definitely better with this phone. I am pleased with the purchase."
"When i saw the launch of this phone I was pretty underwhelmed.......however i still ordered the phone and i am pretty satisfied with it.

This phone is very comfortable to hold without a case on it. The curved edges make a big difference.
As for the look of the phone - i like it. Many like the boxy look of the 24 ultra but i don't have any issues.

So far my only complaint is the removal of Bluetooth for s pen and software update.
It is an utterly poor excuse from Samsung for removing that feature even though they claim less than 1 percent uses it.
Just because i do not use my spare tire on my car regularly does not mean i do not want it on my vehicle. When i do need it i am happy that its there when i need it. Sammy should fix this ASAP

As for software......it is February and the phone is still on December patch.....

Overall though....great device"
"I like this new phone overall, BUT THIS PHONE does NOT PLAY M4A MUSIC using SAMSUNG's OWN MUSIC PLAYER, even though it says it DOES! LOTS OF PEOPLE MENTIONED PROBLEM ONLINE and it is still not fixed by Samsung.

I have hundred+ M4A songs on my phone that play perfectly fine on my desktop Music Player, so I really do not want to convert them all to M3. After hours of searching, looks like only option is to download a DIFFERENT MUSIC PLAYER. That is ridiculous and very annoying."
